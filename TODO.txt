Feature:
    IP:PORT Address in User configs

Problem:
    IP:PORT Address of Pkr-Base(Service) should be stored in User configs instead of Pkr-Cli or Data Service's IP:PORT Address

Feature:
    Push Notification IP:PORT Problems

Problem:
    -> When a Receiver requests data from Sender using Pkr-Cli with suppose A.B.C.D:8001 IP Address
    -> Now the sender logs IP of Pkr-Cli instead of Pkr-Base(Service) as a Receiver in his user configs
    -> While notifying users about new pushed data, it notifies the user based on their IP Address of Pkr-Cli not Pkr-Base(Service)

Feasible Solutions:
    -> Make the PORT Address of Pkr-Base constant throughout all users. Not Appropriate Approach but works while development
    -> While exchanging Public Keys or Data, also exchange the PORT Address of each other's Pkr-Base(Service)

Feature:
    Data Transfer with Virtual Machine

Problem:
    To get our own IP Address, DNS lookup is used
    But while requesting to the Virtual Machine, a private IP(192.168.137.1) is used

Feasible Solutions:
    There must be some flag or field provided so user can enter their own IP Address

Future Features:
    -> Auto Update Services & User Interface, e.g. Crowd Strike
